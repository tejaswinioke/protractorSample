# protractorSample
I have created a sample project to test a website http://cafetownsend-angular-rails.herokuapp.com/login to Test login and create employee functionality
I am using page object pattern to reuse the pages.
I run the project with starting the selenium server (webdriver-manager start)
and running the command (protractor protractor_conf.js)
I am still working on it, hence its not a full solution! Thanks
